# New Project

Here's how you can add additional homeworks into Eclipse without importing the entire directory again.

1. Fire up Eclipse. It should look like this:

2. Create a new project. The shortcut to do that is `ctrl+n` (Windows) or `cmd+n` (Mac). You can also do that from the menu by going to `File > New > Java Project`. This window should pop up. Uncheck `Use Default Location` and then select "Browse"

3. Navigate to the `homework-<youruni>/3` (or whichever homework) directory. **This is critical:** Do not add the `/src` directory or the one outside the homework number (ie. `homework-<youruni>`). Instead, do this on the homework directory (usually `homework-<youruni>/1` or whichever homework number yo uhave)

4. You should see the folder being added and the project name being the homework number. Click finish or just bang `enter`.
